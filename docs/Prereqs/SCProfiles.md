# Smart Client profile settings explained

If you customize or create new Smart Client profiles in XProtect and the users assigned to those profiles need to receive access request notification pop-up alerts, you need to include the following setting.

+ **Access Control > Show access request notifications = Yes**

This is the default setting for all Smart Client profiles. All Smart Client profiles in use need to have this setting configured if system users need to view or interact with access control notifications.
