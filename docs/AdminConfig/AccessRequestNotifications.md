2. Click the **Add Access Request Notification** button.

4. Associate cameras, speakers, microphones, and sounds.
5. Click the **Add Command** button and open the **Command** list to select which commands appear on the notification.</br>

    When the notification pops up on the desktop, a sound plays if you choose to include an audible notification. The built-in access request notification doesn't include a sound.

    Access request notifications can trigger pop up notifications from the XProtect rules system, and these notifications don't need to be related to access control hardware devices.</br>
