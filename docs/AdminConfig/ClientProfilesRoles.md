# Client profiles & Roles explained

Smart Client profiles and user roles in XProtect let administrators manage the features available in the XProtect Smart Client.

Smart Client profiles control visibility of access request notifications. Roles define visibility and control of access control features, visibility of the cardholder list, and access request notifications. For example, if a user can't receive access request notifications, their ability to receive notifications can be controlled in either their Smart Client profile or their role.
