# Overlay buttons & commands

Overlay buttons are software buttons capable of being added to video panes in the Smart Client. Anything triggered by a command, can be triggered manually by an overlay button. 

1. When the Smart Client is in setup mode, there is an **Overlay Buttons** panel on the left side of the client.
2. Select the **Access Control** icon.</br>

5. The output commands include activate and deactivate. Once the button is visible on a camera view pane, and the Smart Client is in setup mode, it is possible to re-size, move, and rename the overlay button.</br>
